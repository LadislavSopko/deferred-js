StandaloneDeferred alpha 1
==========================

deferred.js is a standalone implementation of deferreds aims to be fully compatible with $.Deferred found in jQuery 1.5+.

This version has been tested with only a few examples: it may (and will likely!) contains bugs and incompatibilites.

=> The goal is to have a lightweight standalone version of Deferred that can be used without having to include the huge jQuery file.
